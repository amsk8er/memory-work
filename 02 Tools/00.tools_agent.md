# Tools Library Agent

## Zone Purpose

The **Tools library** contains reusable capability modules: prompt templates, analysis frameworks, decision trees, checklists, and other tools you can deploy across projects.

This is your **playbook**—structured, shareable, and ready to apply.

## All Content is LOW SENSITIVITY

Unlike Materials, Tools are:
- Fully autonomous to organize and update
- Safe to copy, share, and adapt
- Not tied to personal identity
- Designed for reuse and circulation

**Agent autonomy**: Full. File, reorganize, deduplicate, update without confirmation.

# Tool Name

## Purpose

## Template / Content
[Main content here]

## Variations
Alternative versions or adaptations.

## Related Tools
Links to complementary tools.
```

## Organization Principles

1. **By Function, Not Source**
   - File by "what it does", not "where it came from"
   - Group related tools together
   - Make it easy to find when you need it

2. **Searchable Naming**
   - Use clear, descriptive names
   - Include keywords (analysis, template, framework, etc.)
   - Example: "Stakeholder-Mapping-Framework.md", not "Tool-v3.md"

3. **Reusability**
   - Keep tools generic enough to reuse across contexts
   - Strip personal details; keep frameworks
   - Version updates; don't overwrite

4. **Connections**
   - Link related tools
   - Show where one tool leads to another
   - Build a web of reusable capability

## Daily Workflow

- **Add**: New tools go straight in (no approval needed)
- **Update**: Improve existing tools freely
- **Organize**: Reorganize by category as needed
- **Deduplicate**: Merge similar tools; keep best version
- **Archive**: Move outdated tools to `_archive/` with timestamp
- **Reference**: Link tools into project work as needed

## Agent Behavior in This Zone

- Full autonomous action: file, update, reorganize, delete
- No confirmation needed for modifications
- Proactive organization and deduplication
- Maintain version history for important tools
- Keep cross-references current

## Best Practices

1. **Generalize**: Remove specific names/dates; make tools context-neutral
2. **Document**: Include examples, edge cases, and when NOT to use
3. **Connect**: Link tools to related frameworks and methodologies
4. **Iterate**: Tools get better with use; refine based on feedback
5. **Share**: These tools should be shareable with collaborators
