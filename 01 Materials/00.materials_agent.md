# Materials Library Agent

## Zone Purpose

The **Materials library** serves as your personal archive of knowledge, methodology, and reference materials. It contains:
- Personal identity documents and profiles
- Methodology frameworks and thinking patterns
- Reading notes and knowledge captures
- Writing style guides and voice documentation
- Contact records and relationship notes
- Archived conversations and interaction logs

This is where you store "who you are" and "how you think"—the foundation for all other work.

## Sensitivity Rules by Directory

### About Me/ — 🔒 HIGH SENSITIVITY

**Rule: Never modify existing content proactively.**

- Any changes to existing files require **item-by-item confirmation**
- Do not infer or auto-update based on observations
- Always propose changes as suggestions, never execute
- Example: "I noticed you said X in Profile.md, but Y contradicts it. Should I update?"
- New additions: OK if directly from user ("add this to About Me")
- Archiving old versions: Propose before moving to `_archive/`

### Methodology/ — ⚠️ MEDIUM SENSITIVITY

- New additions: Direct filing OK (from notes, captured insights, etc.)
- Modifications to existing frameworks: Confirm before updating
- Reorganization: OK if non-destructive (same content, better structure)
- Archiving: Propose before moving outdated patterns

### Thinking/ — ✅ LOW SENSITIVITY

- Full autonomy: File, reorganize, update, create new patterns
- Assume direct capture of thinking process
- No confirmation needed for organizational changes

### Writing Style/ — ⚠️ MEDIUM SENSITIVITY

- New additions: Direct filing OK
- Modifications to tone/voice guidelines: Confirm if changing existing rules
- Adding examples: OK
- Removing or rewording guidelines: Confirm first

### Reading/ — ✅ LOW SENSITIVITY

- Full autonomy: File notes, summaries, clips
- Reorganize by topic, author, theme as needed
- Archive old material freely

### People/ — ⚠️ MEDIUM SENSITIVITY

- New contacts: Direct filing OK
- Modifications to existing relationship notes: Confirm if major updates
- Sensitive information (concerns, conflicts): Confirm before recording
- Archiving: Propose before moving outdated contacts

### Conversations/ — ⚠️ MEDIUM SENSITIVITY

- New records: Direct filing OK
- Sensitive decisions: Confirm before archiving
- Archiving old interactions: Propose if >6 months old
- Analysis/summaries: OK to create without confirmation

## Filing Decision Logic

**File by retrieval context, not source.**

When deciding where to file something:
1. Ask: "Where would I look for this next time I need it?"
2. Don't file by "who told me" or "what format it arrived in"
3. Examples:
   - Email with feedback → People/Feedback Archive, not Inbox
   - Screenshot of a technique → Thinking/, not Downloads
   - Reading note from X person → Reading/, not People/
   - Pattern learned from experience → Methodology/

## Daily Workflow Rules

- **Capture**: File materials as encountered
- **Organize**: Weekly light reorganization OK
- **Protect**: HIGH sensitivity areas use confirmation protocol
- **Archive**: Move outdated material to `_archive/` with timestamp
- **Review**: Quarterly review of About Me/ to ensure accuracy

## Agent Behavior in This Zone

When working in Materials:
- Propose HIGH sensitivity changes (don't execute)
- Execute LOW sensitivity changes (auto-organize, auto-file)
- Confirm MEDIUM sensitivity changes (explain rationale, wait for approval)
- Use retrieval-based filing logic
- Preserve document history (don't overwrite; use versions)
- Never delete content; archive instead
