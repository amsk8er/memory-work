# This Week

## Original Dictation

Paste or dictate your raw thoughts here. This is your unfiltered thinking space. AI will not edit this section — it's where your intentions, questions, and half-formed ideas live in their original form. You'll reference this during your weekend review.

**Instructions**:
- Brain dump: questions, problems, ideas in any order
- Reference meeting notes, email snippets, overheard insights
- Include emotional tone ("frustrated with X," "excited about Y") — these signal priority
- Don't worry about coherence; AI will structure this into tasks

---

## Task List

AI-generated action items from your dictation. Update this throughout the week as you work, add new ideas, or discover dependencies.

**Format**: 
```
- [ ] [ProjectName] Task title — context/subtask (estimated time)
- [ ] [ProjectName] Another task
```

**Status flow**: unchecked → checked → carried to next week (if incomplete) or archived.

### Tasks This Week

- [ ] [ProjectName] First task — brief context (Xh)
- [ ] [ProjectName] Second task — what it involves (Xh)
- [ ] [ProjectName] Third task — why it matters (Xh)

## Reference Materials

AI will populate this section with relevant materials from your library and research. Think of this as your personal Wikipedia sidebar — curated links and snippets that support your current work.

**Format**:
```
### [Project/Topic]
- **[Document Title]** → Brief description of why it's useful
  - From library search (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - Relevant section: [description]
```

### Materials to Add

- [AI will search your library and fill this in during startup]
- [Or add references manually if you know what you need]

## Documents This Week

Output inventory. Track all files created, modified, or completed this week. This helps you see what actually shipped and prevents losing track of work-in-progress.

**Format**:
```
| Document | Status | Location | Notes |
|----------|--------|----------|-------|
| Filename | draft / in-progress / done | /path/to/file | Optional context |
```

**Status definitions**:
- `draft`: First version, incomplete
- `in-progress`: Active work, iteration happening
- `done`: Shipped, reviewed, ready to reference
- `archived`: Moved to library, no longer active

### Outputs This Week

| Document | Status | Location | Notes |
|----------|--------|----------|-------|
| Example Doc | draft | [path] | Awaiting feedback |
| Example Output | done | [path] | Ready to reference |

## Notes
