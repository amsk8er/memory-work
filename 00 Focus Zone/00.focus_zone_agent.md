# Focus Zone Agent

## Zone Overview

The **Focus Zone** is your weekly workspace — everything in active play lives here. One week, one file, clear boundaries. This is where raw ideas meet structured output, where decisions surface and get tracked, and where work-in-progress lives until it's ready to graduate into the library.

The Focus Zone operates on a **seven-day cycle**: you dictate or capture ideas at the start, AI breaks them into actionable tasks, you work through the week, AI tracks progress, and at week-end you review, archive, and prepare for the next sprint.

## Zone Structure

```
00 Focus Zone/
├── _this_week.md              ← Current week file (Layer 1 working memory)
├── 00.focus_zone_agent.md     ← This file (zone rules & workflows)
├── MEMORY_LOG.md              ← Memory system runtime log
├── ITERATION_LOG.md           ← Agent architecture changelog
├── [project files]            ← Active work documents
├── _archive/                  ← Completed week records
└── YYYY-Wnn_schedule.ics      ← Weekly calendar (generated)
```

### Key Files

- **_this_week.md**: Your active weekly dashboard. Contains raw thoughts, task breakdown, reference materials, daily progress, and output tracking.
- **_archive/**: Historical weeks stored as `YYYY-Wnn.md` (e.g., `2026-W07.md`). Read-only; used for retrospective lookup and graduation decisions.
- **MEMORY_LOG.md**: System state log. AI reads the most recent entry on startup to understand what changed last week and what actions carry forward.
- **ITERATION_LOG.md**: Agent version history. Tracks meaningful changes to the system itself (new skills, workflow tweaks, parameter adjustments).

## Weekly File Structure

Each `_this_week.md` contains **five distinct sections**:

### 1. Original Dictation
**Purpose**: Preserve raw thoughts without filtering.

Your unfiltered input — ideas, questions, half-formed plans, notes from meetings. AI will not edit this section; it serves as the source material. When you review this week, you'll have your own thinking available in its original form.

### 2. Task List
**Purpose**: Actionable items with context and ownership.

AI-generated from your dictation. Format:
```
- [ ] [Project] Task title — context/subtask (estimated time)
- [ ] [Project] Task title
```

Updated throughout the week as you work, add new ideas, or discover dependencies. Mark items complete as you finish them.

### 3. Reference Materials
**Purpose**: Curated library materials relevant to this week's work.

AI populates this section during startup and as new tasks emerge. Format:
```
### [Project/Topic]
- Link or filepath → Brief description
- From _this search_ (YYYY-MM-DD)
```

Think of this as your personal Wikipedia sidebar — materials AI found that are likely useful for your current work.

### 4. Progress Log
**Purpose**: Daily or work-session updates.

Dated entries (optional timestamps). Captures blockers, decisions made, pivot points, and emotional/energy observations. Format:
```
## Mon [Date]
- Completed: [item]
- Blocker: [issue]
- Next: [plan]

## Tue [Date]
- ...
```

### 5. Documents This Week
**Purpose**: Output inventory and status tracking.

A table tracking all files created, modified, or completed this week:

```
| Document | Status | Location | Notes |
|----------|--------|----------|-------|
| Project Proposal v2 | draft | /path/to/file | Awaiting feedback |
| Meeting Notes [Client] | done | /archive | Ready to reference |
```

This helps you see what actually shipped this week and prevents losing track of WIP.

## Three-Phase Weekly Workflow

### Phase 1: Weekly Startup (Sunday/Monday)
**Goal**: Surface intentions, break them into tasks, confirm plan.

| Step | Who | Action | Output |
|------|-----|--------|--------|
| 1a | User | Dictate or paste raw thoughts into Original Dictation section | Raw list |
| 1b | AI | Read dictation, break into tasks, identify dependencies | Task list draft |
| 1c | AI | Search library for relevant reference materials | Materials list |
| 1d | AI | Extract any time-bound items; propose calendar blocks | Calendar draft |
| 1e | User | Confirm tasks, reorder, add details, approve calendar | Locked weekly plan |

**Expected output**: `_this_week.md` fully populated with tasks, references, and schedule ready to execute.

---

### Phase 2: Mid-Week Progress (Tuesday–Thursday)
**Goal**: Keep momentum, capture emerging work, unblock decisions.

| Step | Who | Trigger | Action |
|------|-----|---------|--------|
| 2a | User | Add new ideas or tasks | Append to Original Dictation + Task List |
| 2b | AI | (On next message) | Check for new items, add references if needed |
| 2c | User | Mark completed tasks | Update checkboxes in Task List |
| 2d | User | Log blockers or decisions | Add to Progress Log |
| 2e | AI or User | Blocker/decision is high-stakes | AI can surface memory or pattern match; user decides next step |

**Expected behavior**: Incremental, lightweight updates. No forced reorganization mid-week.

---

### Phase 3: Weekend Archive (Thursday Evening–Sunday)
**Goal**: Confirm outputs, decide what stays, what archives, what carries forward.

| Step | Who | Action | Output |
|------|-----|--------|--------|
| 3a | User | Review Documents This Week table | List what shipped vs. WIP |
| 3b | AI | Match shipped outputs to tasks | Confirm completion accuracy |
| 3c | User | Run memory-review skill | Open-ended reflection conversation |
| 3d | AI | Extract insights, propose memory writes | Capture patterns and decisions |
| 3e | User | Confirm memory updates | Approve what goes into Layer 2/3 |
| 3f | AI | Archive this week + prep next | Move to _archive/, update MEMORY_LOG, create next `_this_week.md` |

**Expected output**: Clean archive, memory system updated, MEMORY_LOG refreshed, unfinished tasks inherit to next week.

---

## Archive Rules

### What Moves to Archive
- **Completed work** (projects finished, deliverables shipped)
- **Closed tasks** (marked done for more than one week)
- **Historical reference** (meeting notes, decisions, past iterations)

### What Stays in Focus Zone
- **Work-in-progress** (actively being edited; inherited from previous week)
- **Blocked items** (waiting for feedback or resources)
- **Current week file** (_this_week.md for active week)

### Archive Naming & Storage

When a week closes:
1. Rename `_this_week.md` → `YYYY-Wnn.md` (e.g., `2026-W07.md`)
2. Move to `_archive/`
3. Create fresh `_this_week.md` for new week

Inherited items:
- Unfinished tasks from previous week appear in Task List (marked with [inherited])
- Memory-review identified actions appear in MEMORY_LOG under "Iteration Actions for Next Week"

---

## Calendar Generation (ics-generator)

When tasks have time commitments, AI can generate calendar files for easy import.

### Trigger
- User mentions dates/deadlines in dictation or task details
- AI proposes calendar blocks during startup
- User approves

### Workflow
1. **Identify**: Scan Task List for time-bound items
2. **Propose**: Suggest time block (duration, day, conflict check)
3. **Confirm**: User reviews and approves or adjusts
4. **Generate**: Create `.ics` file (YYYY-Wnn_schedule.ics)
5. **Import**: User drags into macOS Calendar, Google Calendar, Outlook, or any .ics-compatible tool

### Example
```
Task: "Design sprint kickoff — 2h, need team"
AI proposes: Monday 10:00–12:00, shared with [team members]
User: "Perfect, mark it"
AI: Generates and user imports YYYY-Wnn_schedule.ics
```

## Startup Sequence (Memory System Integration)

Every session start (or week start):

1. **datetime-check**: Confirm current date/week
2. **Read** `_this_week.md` header → Understand current week status
3. **Read** `MEMORY_LOG.md` (most recent entry) → What carried over, what changed
4. **Scan** Focus Zone for new files → Detect modifications, unexpected outputs
5. **Read** Original Dictation section → Refresh context
6. **Report**: Colloquial update ("I see you've been working on the proposal... new docs landed")

---

## Desensitization & Open-Source Use

This template is **generalized for open-source reuse**. When using memory-work-v2:

- Replace project names with placeholders (e.g., `[ProjectName]`)
- Omit specific client names, revenue figures, or internal strategy
- Use `_this_week.md` as a template for your own weekly files; content is yours to populate
- `_archive/` is write-once: once archived, treat as historical log (safe to share in open-source examples)

---

## Zone Parameters (Baseline v1.0)

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Weekly cycle** | Sun–Sun or Mon–Mon | Flexible; choose your anchor |
| **Archive trigger** | End of calendar week | Or manual user decision |
| **Task list sync** | Real-time | User updates anytime; AI tracks next message |
| **Reference search** | Startup + on-demand | AI searches library when new tasks emerge |
| **Memory write** | Weekend review | Batched during memory-review skill |
| **Inheritance timeout** | 1 week | Stale tasks auto-bump for decision next week |

---

## Key Conventions

- **Links**: Use relative paths within the library (e.g., `../01 Materials/reference.md`)
- **Status labels**: `draft`, `in-progress`, `blocked`, `done`, `archived`
- **Time estimates**: Format as `(Xh)` or `(Xh + Yd)` (hours + days)
- **Tags**: Use `[ProjectName]` or `[TopicArea]` for easy filtering
